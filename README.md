#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
Its importance is as follows:
i)ensure that software products are reliable and meet quality standards
ii)software can be designed to scale effectively as user demand increases, which is crucial for technology companies aiming to grow
iii)helps minimize costs associated with development, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
iv)helps minimize costs associated with development, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Birth of software engineering:marked the recognition of software development as a distinct engineering discipline, necessitating structured approaches to address the growing complexity of software systems.
2.Introduction of structured programming: emphasized the use of control structures (like loops and conditionals) rather than unstructured jumps.
3.Agile Manifesto: emphasized principles such as customer collaboration, responsiveness to change, and delivering working software frequently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering user needs and system requirements.
Design:creating high level and detailed design of system architecture and user interface.
Implementation: writing code and building software in line with specification.
Testing: carrying out tests to ensure the software meets standards.
Deployment: releasing it to users
Mantainance: providing support, updates and enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is linear and sequantial while agile is iterative and incrimental.
Waterfall finish a phase at a time while agile is broken doen to sprints.
Waterfall is well documented while agile is adaptive to changes eg user feedback.
Scenarios: Waterfall is used in regulatory projects, small projects and infrastructure development while agile is used in start up projects,complex projects and long term projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g Visual Studio.
 Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg. Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. Helps in early detection of bugs and quality code.
Integration testing assesses the interactions between different modules or components of the software. Helps in interface verification and improved system cohesion.
System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software application. Helps in end to end functionality and user environment simulation.
Acceptance testing is conducted to determine if the software meets the acceptance criteria set by stakeholders. Helps in validation against requirements and risk mitigation.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively communicate with AI language.Prompt engineering is a vital skill for effectively interacting with AI models. By crafting thoughtful and specific prompts, users can enhance the relevance, clarity, and utility of AI-generated content, ultimately leading to more successful and meaningful engagements with artificial intelligence.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt
Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare in the last five years, focusing on patient care and diagnosis.”
Explanation of Improvement

Clarity:The improved prompt clearly specifies the topic of interest—artificial intelligence in healthcare—removing ambiguity about what aspect of technology to discuss.
Specificity: It narrows the focus to a particular timeframe (the last five years) and specific areas of impact (patient care and diagnosis), guiding the AI to provide a more targeted response.
Conciseness: The improved prompt is concise yet comprehensive enough to direct the AI effectively. It avoids unnecessary details while ensuring essential context is included.
Effectiveness
The improved prompt is more effective because it:
- Reduces the likelihood of receiving irrelevant or overly broad information.
- Encourages the AI to deliver a detailed, informative, and structured response tailored to the user's specific needs.
- Saves time for the user by providing a focused output that can be directly applied to their inquiry. 

Overall, a well-crafted prompt maximizes the value of the interaction with the AI.
